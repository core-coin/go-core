This directory contains accounts for testing.
The password that unlocks them is "foobar".

The "good" key files which are supposed to be loadable are:

- File: UTC--2020-02-27T09-51-06.983129511Z--e8cf4629acb360350399b6cff367a97cf36e62b9

- File: zzz
  Address: 0x348d6db8bfe52ab1199deeacbc4c1ffa0686d149

The other files (including this README) are broken in various ways
and should not be picked up by package accounts:

- File: no-address (missing address field, otherwise same as "aaa")
- File: garbage (file with random data)
- File: empty (file with no content)
- File: swapfile~ (should be skipped)
- File: .hiddenfile (should be skipped)
- File: foo/... (should be skipped because it is a directory)
